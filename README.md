**IMPORTANT LINKS**

Since we have two prototypes, each has its own pros and cons.

1. [Coded Prototype](https://buoyr-dsc.vercel.app/)
2. [Figma Hi-Fo Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/SaPwyyBmNl4w5o3oP1iAW5/Pitch-Deck?node-id=171%3A207&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=110%3A0)

Please follow me here! Let's innovate!

## If you are using the Coded Prototype 

Please follow the link above to get started!

This one is the most accurate prototype we built. 
It includes the basic functionality (from the proposal). 
Since time is also a factor when creating this prototype,
we used the React Material UI. The placements of menu, buttons, 
IDE, and general layout are still the same with out
Hi-Fi, but this one has minimal to effective design. 

**Guides**
1. Use the [Anchor AVP](https://youtu.be/htHoZzHeJGE) link.

**Functionality we created**
1. Server-side Authentication integrated with Firebase Auth 
2. Server-side generation of pages
3. Courses Page
4. Workspaces Page
5. Community Page 

**NOTE** 
1. Bugs may occur when signing in.

4. Contact the developer **the owner of this repo**

## If you are using the Hi-Fi Prototype 

Please follow the link above to get started!

This one is the most creative prototype we built. 
It includes all the essential pages of the polished
application. When trying to navigate the prototype, 
please be patient since it is rendered in Figma. 

**Guides**

**Functionality we created**
1. All pages 
2. Basic UX 

**NOTE**
